You will begin to ask the right questions and come up with good answers to deliver valuable insights for your organization. This course starts with the basics and assumes you do not have any knowledge or skills in SQL. It will build on that foundation and gradually have you write both simple and complex queries to help you select data from tables. You'll start to work with different types of data like strings and numbers and discuss methods to filter and pare down your results. You will create new tables and be able to move data into them. You will learn common operators and how to combine the data. You will use case statements and concepts like data governance and profiling. You will discuss topics on data, and practice using real-world programming assignments. You will interpret the structure, meaning, and relationships in source data and use SQL as a professional to shape your data for targeted analysis purposes. Although we do not have any specific prerequisites or software requirements to take this course, a simple text editor is recommended for the final project. So what are you waiting for? This is your first step in landing a job in the best occupation in the US and soon the world!\n"

So in this module, we're going to start there, and we'll define SQL and discuss how SQL differs from other computer languages. I'll also explain the various ways that SQL is used within a database. From there, we'll compare and contrast the roles of a database administrator and a data scientist and explain the differences between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships with the database. Once we've covered that, we'll learn our first statement, select, talk about some of the basic syntax rules and go over the importance of commenting in your code, so that you can start working on and writing some simple queries right away.

        "Welcome back. In this sub-module, we're going to continue where we left off in our last sub-module, by talking a little bit about the evolution of data modeling, and consequently, SQL database systems themselves. It's actually a pretty interesting history, that really begins in the 1960s as computers were really coming into their own as a business and research tool. After this particular lesson, you should be able to describe what data modeling is, define a relational database system and discuss advent of the relational databases in SQL. Data modelling is what we use to organize information for multiple tables and how they relate to each other together. This helps tremendously in providing structure to the information in the system. Usually a data model represents a business process and it can also help you understand a business process. A lot of times you'll work with a business person in understanding the data and how it fits together. But at the same time, that business person will learn a lot from the data modeller to better understand how their business actually works together by seeing the data and how it interacts with each other. The thing to remember about data models is that it should always represent a real world problem as closely as possible. There are couple different types of models, and there has been an evolution of data models. When I talk about data models here, it's important to realize the difference between a model for prediction, which data scientist often build, versus a data model, which is really a way that the tables are represented and organized in a database. The evolution of data models has gone on since the 1960s. There's been hierarchical, network, relational, entity, relational semantic, and NoSql. I'm not going to go into great detail into all of these different types of data models. If this is interesting to you, I definitely recommend you do your own research. It's widely available on the internet and it will only help you in other aspects of working with data. I'm just going to briefly talk a little bit about the relational and NoSql. The reason I'm talking about the relational is this is what we're going to work with a lot when writing SQL queries. The benefits of a relational model is that they really simplify the connections between the data. And what it does is easily allow you to write queries against it, retrieve it, update and write data to it. NoSQL came onto the scene around 2009, it was really part of the Big Data movement that you may have heard something about. I think it's important to understand that NoSQL is out there especially as you are learning the SQL course. I think it's also important to realize the differences between the other data models and NoSQL. Just to touch on SQL in a Big Data world, NoSQL is really a mechanism for storage and retrieval where it's not modeled in a tabular relational format. NoSQL was really popular when big data and unstructured data first came out because you left it unstructured, but it's now started to soften a little bit, and more commonly referred to as Not Only SQL. This will be one of the discussion items in this module. Something I want you to think about and research a little bit more is does SQL really have a role still in the Big Data world, as new things start to come out like NoSQL and unstructured data? That wraps it up for this lesson. You should have a good sense of what data modeling is and a basic understanding of a relational database. In the next lesson we'll discuss how relational and transactional databases differ."

        "Okay. Now, let's wrap up our discussion about data models by getting back to talking about the type of data models we'll be working with in this class. After this sub-module, you should be able to define and describe both relational and transactional database models, define entities, attributes and relationship, describe and explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, describe the use of a primary key in a database and explain how ER diagram is used to document and illustrate relationships. I want to kick off this sub-module by talking a little bit about relational versus transactional database models. A relational model is a database design that shows the relationships between the different tables and this is really used to optimize querying data, making it easy and intuitive to access the data. Transactional, on the other hand, you can think of as a more operational database. If you are in healthcare, for example, you may have a transactional database that is used to store all the claims information and then this information may not be stored in a great way for querying and using it for analysis. In fact, you may need to take and extract that transactional information from the database and move it into a relational model. Most of what we will be working with in this class is the relational model. The building blocks for this relational model are really three simple things. We have entities which are a person, place, thing or event. These are very distinguishable. They are unique. They are distinct. For example, I could be an entity, Sadie St. Lawrence, and then we have attributes, which are characteristics of this entity. As an entity, it would be myself and then an attribute about me would be that I am female. Then, the third building block of the model is the relationship. This describes the association among different entities. There are a few types of relationships in a database and the ones I want to cover are the three shown here: one-to-many, many-to-many and one-to-one. If you think of a one-to-many relationship, this could be one customer that has many invoices. When you think of a many-to-many relationship, this could be an example of many students to many classes. You may have one student who belongs to lots of different classes or you may have a class who has many different students. Then, if you think of a one-to-one relationship, this is a manager to a store. Let's say you have a sporting goods store and each of those stores has only one manager. That would be one example of a one-to-one relationship. To understand these relationships between the tables a lot better, what's often used to depict this are ER diagrams. An ER model then is composed of the entity types and the specific relationships that can exist between these entities. These are usually displayed in a visual format and a relate represents a relationship between the tables. It often helps you to understand and represent a business process and it will show the links between these tables. The links are really important because in a later lesson, we're going to learn how to join these tables together and combine the data. Being able to look at this diagram and see how they relate to each other is really important. What we will use to join these tables together are two things. We can use the primary keys or foreign keys. The primary key is a column or set of columns whose values uniquely identify every row in a table. Then this allows us to take those unique identities and then join it to another table. Foreign keys are similar but in regard that one or more columns can be used together to identify a single row in the table. When we're looking at ER diagrams, which again is one of the ways you will start to think before you do, you'll look at maybe an ER diagram and understand what data elements you are trying to join together and how do you need to get them. But one of the things you need to understand is how to read this. We talked a little bit about relationships and the different relationships between a table. And then, there was a different type of notation that explains the relationships. We have the Chen notation, and there's the Crow's foot notation, and then there's the UML class diagram notation. The Chen notation uses one-to-M for a one-to-many relationship, and M and N for a many-to-many relationship and a one to one for a one-to-one relationship. In Crow's foot notation, we have the train tracks which represent 1 and then the Crow's foot which represents many. And finally, with UML we have a 1.1 which represents the concept of one and 1.\" which represents the concept of many. Definitely take notes at these. You'll be looking at ER diagrams quite frequently and you'll need to understand these notations when reading ER diagrams so you can understand how you're going to write your query and join the table together or even to find out what's listed in the table. This is really part of that thinking before you start doing' concept I was talking about earlier. Having a good understanding of why the data is structured in a particular way and how to read the ER diagrams will be very helpful to you in writing your queries and ensuring you get accurate results."

        "As shown in this example, I've created a table with several columns, some of which cannot accept null values. Those are not null lines. And the one column that can accept null value, the one line that has null in it. It's important to not confuse null values with empty strings. Null values really are the absence of everything, whereas empty strings, there's actually a value there. It might be spaces or something like that. Another thing that's important to remember is anything that you're defining as a primary key cannot accept null values. So the one line listed here as a primary key wouldn't be able to accept null values for this example. As previously defined in the example, I said that shoe Id was a primary key. Therefore, this can never have an empty value or not any value. The other thing that's important to remember is that if you indicate that a column cannot be null, then you are going to get an error if you do not enter a value into that column when you're inserting data into it. This is just a check to make sure that in the columns that you've determined are non-nulls, values will always be present. Otherwise, you'll get an error returned. In order to get the data into the table after you've defined the table, the columns, and the data types you want to add into it, there are really two ways to do this. The first way is with the insert statement. You can say INSERT INTO Shoes, so I'm saying, I want to put this data into the shoes table. I want to put the values and after that. So in this, I have put the values into a single parentheses. I've listed them out in order. Now this works fine, however I wouldn't recommend using this first example. How this first example is going to work is that it's going to take the first value indicated and put it in the first column. The second value will go to the second column, and the third value into the third column, and so on and so forth. And it will put them in order. As I said before, it works, however it's not recommended. You have no guarantee of what data is going into which column. So it's a lot better to be a little bit more specific about this. For this, what you want to do is you want to use the same statement INSERT INTO Shoes. Before I put the values, I'm going to list the columns that I want it to insert into. Here, I'm listing it in the same order, Shoe Id, Brand, Type, Color, Price, and Description. However, this time after that, I'm also indicating the values that I want to go in that same order. This can be really beneficial if you want to insert just a few values into a column. So for this example, I could remove the first three, so I could remove the Type, Brand, and Id. I would just remove those by crossing those out. Then it also remove the first three values here. Now I'm guaranteed that the values Pink, 695.00 and then NULL are going to go into Color, Price, and Description. I will recommend using this method. It's a little bit safer because you have more control. You know exactly where the data is going and into which column. Okay, so let's stop there for now. In this sub-module, you learned all about how to create tables using SQL. We discuss situations where that's useful thing to do. We talked about the syntax for creating a new table and went over how to store data in it. There's another thing you can do with tables, and that is to create a temporary table. We'll go over this in our next lesson."
